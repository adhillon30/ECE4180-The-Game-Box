# ECE4180-The-Game-Box
ECE 4180 Final Project

# Overview

For the Final Project of ECE 4180, our team designed a mini game console that picks a game at random for a total for 4 games. The system prompts the player to match the output displayed on either the LCD screen or the RGB LED.
Binary Game: Given a decimal value, use the four push buttons to the output in binary.
RGB Game: Use the potentiometers to match the displayed colour.
Distance Game: Use the ultrasonic sensor to match the given distance.
Pattern Game: Use the push buttons to match the displayed patterns on the LCD screen.
